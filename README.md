### Advanced Computer Architecture
- Great use of Verilog code and CUDA Programming

##### Lab 1
- Find adder and multiplier's area and time complexity for different bit-widths 

##### Lab 2
- Analyze implementation of register file 
- Find area and access time of RF of different sizes (number of registers) and for various bit-widths of registers

##### Lab 3
- Simulate four-stage pipelined implementation of R-type instructions and understand its functionality
- Find area and time complexity of the four-stage pipelined architecture
- Simulate five-stage pipelined CPU architecture including data memory to incorporate D-type instructions (STUR and LDUR) and understand its functionality
- Find area and time complexity of the five-stage pipelined architecture

##### Lab 4
- Understand the working of the 5-stage pipelined datapath and simulate the CBZ and B instructions along with the previous R-type and D-type instructions
- Understand the effect of control hazard and eliminate them for the correct result in pipeline

##### Lab 5
- Write basic CUDA programs
- Make use of GPU to solve problem based on parallelism using multi-threading.
